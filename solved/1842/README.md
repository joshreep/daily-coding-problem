This problem was asked by MongoDB.

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than half the time `(> floor(len(lst) / 2.0))`.

You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given `[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0]`, return `1`.

> Note: this example is in correct. You either need more `1's` in the array, or you need to make the "half the time" calculation `>=` instead of `>` to make this work.
